In this optional extension to module 2, you will update your serverless backend for your Wild Rydes application leveraging [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) and [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) to use request signing with IAM-based authorization as a more secure authentication option.

If you would like to skip this optional extension, you are able to proceed to module 3 directly, IAM-based Authorization.
