In this module, you will add a serverless backend to your Wild Rydes application leveraging [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) and [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/). You will then enable authentication and authorization on your API to secure the backend to only accept valid, authorized requests.
